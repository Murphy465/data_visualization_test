This approach offers several benefits, including preserving table-level detail and helping to avoid issues like data duplication or incorrect aggregations.\nTo practice creating relationships and to better understand how they affect the level of detail in your visualizations, consider downloading Tableau’s Bookshop dataset.\nJoins in Tableau physically merge tables into a single flat table at the data source level, based on a defined join condition (e.g., inner, left, right, or full outer). While useful when both tables share the same level of detail, joins can lead to duplicated rows or inflated values if the join keys aren’t clean or consistent, so careful data preparation is essential.\n\n\nTip - Copilot\n\n\n\nFor a more in-depth exploration of these concepts, ask Copilot to explain the difference between a relationship and a join in Tableau. Copilot will provide a clear breakdown, along with guidance on when to use a relationship versus a join, depending on your data structure and analysis goals.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s enhance the rock_n_roll_performers.csv dataset by relating it to rock_n_roll_studio_albums.csv.\n\nGo to the Data Source page.\nIn the Connections pane, locate rock_n_roll_studio_albums.csv.1\nDrag and drop the table onto the canvas.\nIn the relationship settings, set the relationship as:\nArtist = Artist1.\n\n\nVideo showing steps 1-4 above",

Horizontal and vertical bar charts are especially effective for visualizing rank-based comparisons, making it easy to see which values stand out.\n\n\nTip: One Task, Multiple Approaches\n\n\n\n\nTableau loves options—there’s almost always more than one way to do the same thing!!!\n\n\n\n\n📊 Bar Chart\nLet’s build a bar chart that highlights the average U.S. peak chart positions for albums by 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductees.\n\nIn the Data Pane scroll down to find the rock_n_roll_studio_albums.csv table .\nDouble click Peak US to instantly generate a bar chart showing the total sum of US peak chart positions.\n\nNow let’s refine the chart to focus on specific artists and show average values instead:\n\nScroll up in the Data Pane to find the rock_n_roll_performers.csv table.\nDrag Artist to the Filters Shelf.\nIn the filter dialog, select the following 2025 inductees:\n\nBad Company\nChubby Checker\nJoe Cocker\nCyndi Lauper\nOutkast\nSoundgarden\nThe White Stripes\n\nDrag Artist to the Columns Shelf.\nOn the Rows Shelf, click the ▼ caret on SUM(Peak US) and change the aggregation form SUM to AVERAGE.\nRight-click the sheet tab and rename it BarChart1.\n\n\nVideo showing the steps 1-6 below\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: Worksheet Names File\n\n\nAlways give your worksheets clear, meaningful names—this makes it much easier to organize and navigate your dashboards or stories later on.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Tableau pills\nIn Tableau, dimensions appear as blue pills and measures as green pills. Adding a dimension (like Artist) disaggregates the data in your view. Many Tableau features—such as formatting, sorting, or converting data types—are accessed by clicking the ▼ caret on a pill.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1: Bar Chart\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild a bar chart that displays the peak U.S. chart positions for each album released by your favorite artist inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\nOpen a new worksheet\n\nClick the worksheet icon next your Barchart1 tab in the lower-left corner of the Tableau workspace.\n\n\n\nRename the sheet:\n\nRight-click on Sheet2 and rename it BarChart2.\n\n\n\nBuild your bar chart.\n\nUse the album_title dimension and the Peak US measure to create a bar chart showing chart positions for each album.\n\n\n\nExperiment with layout:\n\nClick the Swap button in the toolbar to switch the orientation of the bars (horizontal ↔︎ vertical).\n\n\n\nSort the bars:\n\nUse the Sort ascending button in the toolbar to arrange bars from lowest to highest chart position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Me\nAnother way to create a bar chart in Tableau is by using the Show Me  button located in the upper right corner of the workspace. Before clicking Show Me, hold down the Ctrl key (or Option key on a Mac) while selecting one or more dimensions and/or measures. Tableau will then highlight the chart types that best match your selection.\nIf you pre-select artist, album_title, and Peak US, for example, Tableau will automatically suggests horizontal bar charts as a suitable visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2. Bar Chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen a new worksheet and rename the sheet BarChart3.\n\n\nBuild the initial view:\n\n\nDrag Release date to the Columns shelf.\n\n\nDrag rock_n_roll_studio_albums.csv (Count) to the Rows shelf.\n\nNote: Tableau automatically creates a line chart, because Release date is recognized as a date field.\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the chart type:\n\n\nOn the Marks Card, click the dropdown next to Automatic and select Bar.",

    "text": "Change over time\n\n📈 Line chart\nLine charts are ideal for showing trends over time. When you place Release date on the Columns chelf and rock_n_roll_studio_albums.csv (Count) on the Rows shelf, Tableau automatically generates a line chart—because it recognizes Release date as a date field.\nTableau classifies fields as either discrete or continuous, and this classification affects both the type of chart Tableau creates and how you interact with your data. You can identify the classification by the pill color:\n\nBlue = Discrete\nGreen = Continuous\n\nThis distinction is especially important when working with dates, as they can be treated either way.\n\n📅 Discrete dates\nLet’s walk through an example using discrete dates:\n\nCreate a new worksheet and rename it LineChart1.\nDrag Release date to Columns and rock_n_roll_studio_albums.csv (Count) to Rows.\n\nNotice that Release date appears as a blue pill, indicating it’s being treated as discrete.\nThe pill is labeled YEAR(Release date) and is prefixed with a +, meaning it can be expanded.\n\nExpand the date hierarchy:\n\nClick the + next to YEAR to add QUARTER.\nClick the + again to add MONTH.\nTableau automatically parses discrete dates into parts: year, quarter, month, day.\n\nClean up the view:\n\nRemove YEAR, QUARTER, and DAY from the Columns shelf by dragging them off.\n\nAdd a filter for specific years:\n\nRight-click and drag Release date to the Filters Shelf.\nIn the Filter Field window, select YEARS and click Next.\nChoose 1960-1964, then click OK.\nAgain, Tableau uses blue and green to indicate discrete versus continuous dates.\n\nAdd color by year:\n\nHold Ctrl (or Option on Mac) and drag YEAR from the Filters shelf to the Color shelf on the Marks card.\n\n\n\nNote:The bulk of albums released in January is misleading. When gathering this data, if only a year was provided for release data, the month and day of the release date was automatically set to January 1.`\n\n\n📅 Continuous dates\nNow let’s see how the view changes when Release date is converted from a discrete to a continuous date.\n\nDuplicate the existing sheet:\n\nRight-click on LineChart1 and select Duplicate.\nRename the new sheet LineChart2.\n\nConvert the date field:\n\nClick the ▼ caret on the MONTH(Release date) pill.\nChange the date from the discrete format (e.g. Month (May)) to the continuous format (e.g. Month (May 2015)).\n\n\nAt first glance, the chart may look broken or disjointed. However, if you hover over each line, you’ll see that Tableau is correctly plotting each month across all years on a continuous timeline. The visual choppiness due to the color still being based on the discrete year.\nTo smooth out the visualization and better highlight trends:\n\nRemove the YEAR(Release date) pill from Color.\nAdd color based on values:\n\nDrag a copy of rock_n_roll_studio_albums.csv (Count) to Color shelf on the Marks card.\n\n\nThis change applies a diverging color palette based on the count values, helping to highlight highs and lows in the data. The result is a smoother, more insightful trend chart that emphasizes variation over time.",

This behavior is especially noticeable when using scatterplots to analyze relationships between two or more measures.\n\nTo break down or disaggregate the data point, add a lower level of detail to the view.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3. Scatterplots\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a scatterplot to compare the Peak US and Peak UK chart positions for albums released by your favorite artist inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\nOpen a new worksheet and rename it Scatterplot1.\n\n\nBuild the scatterplot:\n\n\nDrag Peak US to the Columns shelf.\n\n\nDrag Peak UK to the Rows shelf.\n\n\n\n\nFilter by artist:\n\n\nDrag Artist to the Filters shelf and select your favorite artist.\n\n\n\n\nAdd detail:\n\n\nDrag album_title to Detail on the Marks card.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy adding album_title to Detail, you increase the granularity of the view. Now, each mark (circle) represents a unique album, plotted by its Peak US and Peak UK chart positions. This allows for more detailed and meaningful comparison across individual albums.\n\n\nTip: Outliers\n\n\n\nOutliers can significantly distort the results of a scatterplot, so it’s important to handle them thoughtfully. Tableau makes it easy to exclude outlier data points: simply click on a mark to open the tooltip and select 🛇 Exclude, or right-click the mark and choose X Exclude.\n\n\nHowever, always be sure to document your approach to handling outliers.

When used appropriately, however, a text table can complement visual elements by providing precise values, detailed comparisons, or supporting context that enhances the overall understanding of your data.\nLet’s walk through how to create a text table that displays the the peak chart positions in every country for each album released by The Beatles.\n\nStart a new worksheet and rename it TextTable.\nFilter the data:\n\nDrag Artist to the Filters shelf and select The Beatles.\n\nSelect the relevant fields:\n\nClick on album_title\nHold Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) and click Peak AUS\nThen hold Shift and click Peak US to select all measures between them. \n\n\nOpen Show Me and select Text Tables.\nIn the Toolbar, change the view from Standard to Entire View .\nAdjust the width of the album_title column for better readability.\n\n\nWhat Tableau does behind the scenes\n\nA blue Measure Names pill now appears on the Columns shelf.\nA green Measure Values pill is placed on Label on the Marks Card.\nEach selected measure now appears on a separate Measure Values card under the Marks Card.\n\n\n\nCustomizing the table\n\nReorder columns by dragging measures on the Measures Values card.\nRemove a measure by dragging it off the Measure Values card.\n\n\n\nTip - Set Default Properties\n\n\n\nTo save time and ensure consistency, try setting Default Properties for dimensions and measures before starting a Tableau project.\n\n\n\n\nRight-click on each measure that begins with “Peak”.\n\n\nScroll to Default Properties, and select Number Format.\n\n\nChoose Number Standard from the formatting options.\n\n\nThis ensures that all selected measures display in a consistent numeric format throughout your workbook, reducing the need for repetitive formatting later on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCallout numbers\nSometimes one large, single number can make the most powerful statement in a data visualization. Callout numbers are used to highlight key takeaways and can be easily created in Tableau with a few formatting steps.\nLet’s create a callout number to emphasize the Peak US chart position for The Beatles’ album Abbey Road.\nTo emphasize the Peak US chart position for The Beatles album Abbey Road:\n\nDuplicate the existing sheet:\n\nRight-click the TextTable sheet tab and select Duplicate.\nRename the new sheet Callout\n\nSimplify the view:\n\nRemove all Measure Values starting with “Peak” except SUM(Peak US).\n\nFilter to a single album:\n\nIn the view, right-click Abbey Road and choose ✔ Keep only.\n\nFormat the number:\n\nRight-click on the number (e.g., 2) and select Format to open the Formatting Pane.\nFrom the Fields ▼ dropdown in the Formatting Pane, select SUM(Peak US).\nUnder Font, increase the font size from 9 to 72.\nUnder Alignment, set the horizontal and vertical alignment to Center.\n\nClean up the view:\n\nDrag album_title from the Rows shelf to Detail on the Marks card.\n\nAdd a caption:\n\nRight-click in the gray space under the Marks card and select Caption.\nDouble-click the Caption area to edit it.\nDelete defaulat text and type: Peak US chart position.\nHighlight the text and select center in the edit caption window.\n\n\nWith just a few additional formatting tweaks, you’ll have a clean, impactful callout number ready to be featured in your Tableau dashboard.",

    "section": "🧮 Calculated fields",
    "text": "🧮 Calculated fields\nCalculated fields empower you to transform your data directly within Tableau. You can use them to clean and organize data, define custom segments, add interactivity, and even perform statistical or mathematical calculations—all without modifying the original dataset.\nFor example, in the rock_n_roll_studio_albums table, you’ll find album certification statuses from organizations like the RIAA, BPI, and ARIA. With calculated fields, you can standardize these certifications, compare award levels across countries, or even create new fields that group albums by global recognition—making your analysis more insightful and dynamic.\nLet’s take a closer look at how calculated fields work by analyzing RIAA certifications for our favorite albums.\nOver time, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has updated its certification standards to reflect changes in how music is consumed. Originally based solely on album sales, certifications now account for digital downloads and streaming activity. To keep things simple, we’ll use the current criteria for album-level awards, as defined by the RIAA in February 2016:\n🎵 RIAA Certification Levels - Gold: 500,000 units - Platinum: 1,000,000 units - Multi-Platinum: 2,000,000+ units (in 1,000,000-unit increments) - Diamond: 10,000,000 units\n💽 What Counts as a Unit? A single unit can be any of the following:\n\nOne full digital or physical album sale\n10 track downloads from the same album\n1,500 on-demand audio or video streams from the album\n\nUsing this framework, we can create a calculated field in Tableau to categorize albums by their certification level based on total units.\n\nStart a new worksheet and rename it CalculatedFields\nBuild a text table\n\nDrag Favorite albums to the Filters Shelf and select Favorite albums.\nDrag album_title to Rows.\nDrag Certification Riaa Status to Text on the Marks Card.\nRight-click any album titles with no certification and select ❌ Exclude.\n\nCreate a calculated field\n\nIn the Data Pane, click the ▼ caret next to the search bar and choose Create Calculated Field.\nName the field Number of units.\nClick the ▶ caret on the right side of the Calculation Editor to explore available functions.\nUse an IF statement to assign unit values based on certification: assign units to each certification category.\n\n\nIF &lt;expr&gt; THEN &lt;then&gt; [ELSEIF] &lt;expr2&gt; THEN &lt;then2&gt; …] [ELSE &lt;else&gt;] END\n\n\nif [Certification Riaa Status]='Gold' then 500000\nelseif [Certification Riaa Status]='Platinum' then 1000000\nelseif [Certification Riaa Status]='Multiplatinum' then 2000000\nelseif [Certification Riaa Status]='Diamond' then 10000000\nend\n\n\nAdd the calculated field to view\n\nOn the Marks Card, replace Certification Riaa Status with the calculated field Number of units.\n\nClean up and enhance the view\n\nRemove borders and shading:\n\nGo to Format &gt; Borders.\n\nOn Sheet tab, set Row Divider to None.\n\nOn Formatting Pane, go to Shading.\n\nOn Sheet tab, set row banding to None on Pane and Header.\n\n\nHide field labels:\n\nRight-click album_title and select Hide Field Labels for Rows.\n\nEdit the text display:\n\nOn the Marks Card, click Text and click the … button next to the text box..\nEnter the word units after &lt;SUM(Number of units)&gt; for clarity.\n\n\n\n\nVideo of steps 1-5 above",

    "text": "What is data literacy?\n\n\n\nData literacy is a journey\n\n\nStrengthening your ability to evaluate and work with data will empower you to use data more effectively and responsibly.\n\n\n\nData literacy defined\nData literacy is “the ability to read, work with, analyze, and argue with data.”\n\nReading data: Understanding what data represents and how it reflects the world around us.\nWorking with data: Creating, acquiring, cleaning, and managing datasets.\nAnalyzing data: Filtering, sorting, aggregating, comparing, and analyzing data.\nArguing with data: Using data to support a narrative that is intended to communicate some message or story to a particular audience. (Bhargava and D’Ignazio 2015)\n\nData literacy concepts and competencies are integrated throughout this tutorial to help you build strong skills in data visualization and storytelling. In addition to interpreting and evaluating data, we’ll explore data handling, data synthesis, ethical use of data, and best practices for presenting data effectively.\nWhen looking at data collected by others - whether it is raw data or data published in an article - it is important to understand what the data means, how it was collected, and who collected it. You must critically evaluate each data source before you consider using data to support an argument. Approach your data with curiosity and some skepticism.\nUse the DRAMA Framework to evaluate your data. (Primeau, n.d.)\n\n\n\n\nDRAMA Framework\n\n\n \n\n\nDate\n\n\nWhen was the data last updated? Is it current? Does it reflect current trends?  \n\n\nRelevance\n\n\nWhat procedures were used to collect the data? Is the data relevant to my research project? Did sampling procedures target the right audience or population? What was the context for collecting the data? Is there a description of the data set and what data it does and does not contain?  \n\n\nAccuracy\n\n\nIs the data reliable? Valid? Were procedures for gathering the data followed consistently?  \n\n\nMotivation\n\n\nWhy was the data collected? Are there any potential biases in the data? Was any relevant data not included in the dataset? If yes, was this disclosed?  \n\n\nAuthority\n\n\nWho collected the data? an individual? a government agency? a business? or a political action committee? Are they credible?",

The lessons guide you through each step, and are complemented by readings that highlight best practices for data visualization. The texts are available through The Ohio State University Libraries for faculty, students and staff, and include:\n\n\n\n\nBETTER DATA VISUALIZATIONS\n\n\n\n\nBetter Data Visualizations: A Guide for Scholars, Researchers, and Wonks\n\n\n\n\nby Jonathan Schwabish\n\n\nNew York : Columbia University Press, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEFFECTIVE DATA VISUALIZATION\n\n\n\n\nEffective Data Visualization: The Right Chart for the Right Data\n\n\n\n\nby Stephanie Evergreen\n\n\nThousand Oaks, California: SAGE Publications, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTORYTELLING WITH DATA\n\n\n\n\nStorytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals\n\n\n\n\nby Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic\n\n\nHoboken, New Jersey: Wiley, 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince practice is one of the most effective ways to learn data visualization, each lesson also includes activites that encourage you to apply what you’ve learned to a dataset that is meaningful to you. The lesson then concludes with a reflection prompt, inviting you to consider the skills you’ve developed and how you might apply these skills to a future project.",

    "text": "Using loops with lists\nWhen working with lists, it’s a good practice to use plural names for your list variables. This makes your code easier to read and understand—especially when you’re iterating through each element.\nPython’s for loop allows you to iterate over items in a sequence—such as a list, tuple, dictionary, or string—and execute a block of code for each item.\nBasic Syntax\n\nfor item in sequence\n     #Code to execute for each item\n\n\nExamples:\n\nLoop through the characters list.\n\n\nfor character in characters:\n    print(character)\n\nRey\nR2D2\nLuke Skywalker\nHan Solo\nC3PO\nBB-8\n\n\n\nUse slicing to print names of the last 3 characters:\n\n\nfor character in characters[-3:]:\n    print(character)\n\nHan Solo\nC3PO\nBB-8\n\n\n\nUse conditional statements to add a comment for each character:\n\n\nfor character in characters:\n    if character == 'BB-8' or character=='R2D2' or character == 'C3PO':\n        print(f\"{character} is a robot\")\n    elif character == 'Luke Skywalker':\n        print('Luke is Leia\\'s brother')\n    elif character == 'Han Solo':\n        print('Chewbacca is Han Solo\\'s friend')\n    elif character == 'Rey':\n        print(\"Rey rocks\")\n\nRey rocks\nR2D2 is a robot\nLuke is Leia's brother\nChewbacca is Han Solo's friend\nC3PO is a robot\nBB-8 is a robot\n\n\nNote the line f\"{character} is a robot\" in the first conditional statement of the loop. This is known as an f-string, short for formatted string literal.\nAn f-string is created by placing the letter f directly before the opening quotation mark of a string. This allows you to embed variables or expressions inside the string using curly braces {}. Python will automatically evaluate the expression and insert its value into the string.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Loops\n\n\n\n\nPrint the name of each president of The Ohio State University.\npresidents=[\"Edward Francis Baxter Orton Sr\",\"Walter Quincy Scott\",\"William Henry Scott\",\"James Hulme Canfield\",\"William Oxley Thompson\",\n            \"George Washington Rightmire\",\"William McPherson\",\"Howard Landis Bevis\",\"Novice Gail Fawcett\",\"Harold Leroy Enarson\",\n            \"Edward Harrington Jennings\",\"E.

    "title": "Mastering the Basics",
    "section": "Arguments and parameters",
    "text": "Arguments and parameters\nWhen defining a function, you can include parameters inside the parentheses. These parameters act as placeholders for values that will be passed into the function when it’s called. This allows your function to work dynamically with different inputs.\nIn this example:\n\nname is a parameter—a variable defined in the function header.\nWhen the function is called, you provide an argument—a specific value that replaces the parameter.\n\n\ndef say_hello(name):\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}\")\n\n\nCalling the function with an argument\n\nsay_hello(\"Sarah\")\n\nHello, Sarah\n\n\nThis makes your function flexible and reusable with different inputs.\n\n\nParameters vs. arguments\n\nA parameter is a variable listed inside the parentheses when defining a function. It acts as a placeholder for the value the function will receive.\n\n\ndef function_name(parameter):\n    # function body\n\n\nAn argument is the actual value you pass into the function when calling it.\n\n\n\nfunction_name(argument)\n\n\nIf a function is defined with a parameter, you must provide a corresponding argument when calling the function—otherwise, Python will raise an error.\n\n\n\nPositional vs. keyword arguments\nWhen calling a function in Python, you can pass arguments in two main ways: positional and keyword.\n\n1. Positional arguments\nBy default, Python matches arguments to parameters based on their position in the function call. The first argument is assigned to the first parameter, the second to the second, and so on.\n\ndef describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):\n    print(f\"\\nI have a {animal_type}\")\n    print(f\"\\nMy {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name.title()}.\")\n\n\n#FUNCTION CALLED WITH CORRECT POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS    \ndescribe_pet('dog','stanley') \n\n\nI have a dog\n\nMy dog's name is Stanley.\n\n\n\n#FUNCTION CALLED WITH INCORRECT POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS    \ndescribe_pet('stanley','dog') \n\n\nI have a stanley\n\nMy stanley's name is Dog.\n\n\n\n\n2. Keyword arguments\nWith keyword arguments, you explicitly specify which value goes to which parameter using the parameter=value syntax. This removes the dependency on the order of arguments.\n\ndef describe_pet(pet_name=\"name\",animal_type='species'):\n    print(f\"I have a {animal_type}\")\n    print(f\"My {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name.title()}.\")\n\npet_description=describe_pet(pet_name='Charlotte', animal_type='spider')\n\nI have a spider\nMy spider's name is Charlotte.\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn Values from Functions\nSo far, we’ve used print() to display output from functions. However, functions can also return values using the return statement. This allows you to store the result and use it later.\n\ndef format_name(first_name, last_name):\n    full_name=f\"{first_name} {last_name}\"\n    return full_name.title()\n\nname=format_name('sarah','murphy')\nprint(name)\n\nSarah Murphy\n\n\nReturning values is useful when you want to process data and use the result elsewhere in your program.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10: Functions\n\n\n\n\nMake a function that transforms a book title to lower case, then call your function.\n#define your function first. Give it a name and assign a parameter.\n    #your code block here\n    return #your code here\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\ndef lowercase(title):\n    lowercase_title=title.lower()\n    return lowercase_title\n\n\nbook=\"Loansome Dove\"\nlowercase(book)",

However, data visualization experts often discourage their use because humans struggle to accurately compare angles and areas, making interpretation less precise than other chart types.\nThat said, there are situations where a pie chart may be appropriate—such as when the audience expects it or when it provides a clear and immediate visual impact.\nLet’s return to our rock_n_roll_performers dataset to explore the pie chart.\n\nStart a new worksheet and rename it PieChart\nSet the active data source\n\nOn the Data Pane, select rock_n_roll_performers.\nThe fields for the rock_n_roll_performers and rock_n_roll_studio_albums should appear.\n\nFilter by 2025 inductees\n\nChange Year to Date & Time data type (if not already).\nFilter for the Discrete Year: 2005.\n\nCreate the pie chart\n\nOn the Marks Card change the marks type to Pie.\n\nColor the pie with a dimension\n\nOn the Marks Card, drag Artist to Color.\nIn the Toolbar, change the view from Standard to Entire View.\n\nSize the slices with a measure\n\nOn the Marks Card, drag rock_n_roll_studio_albums.csv (Count) to Size\n\nAdd a descriptive title\n\nDouble click the worksheet title PieChart.\nEnter:\n\nNumber of Albums Released by 2025 Inductees\n\n\nEnhance clarity\n\nCopy Artist and rock_n_roll_studio_albums.csv (Count) to Label on the Marks Card.\nClick Label on the Marks Card and select the … tile next to Text.\nEnter:\n\nalbums next to &lt;CNT(rock_n_roll_studio_albums.csv)&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonut chart\nThe donut chart is a variation of the pie chart, distinguished by its blank center. This design not only offers a cleaner visual but also makes it slightly easier for viewers to compare the relative sizes of each category.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4. Donut Chart\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Donut Chart showing the number of albums released by 2025 Rock N Roll Hall of Fame inductees.\n\n\n\nDuplicate the existing sheet\n\n\nRight-click on PieChart and select Duplicate.\n\n\nRename the new sheet DonutChart.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a calculated field\n\n\nDouble click on the Rows shelf and type avg(0).\n\n\nIt doesn’t really matter whether you use average, minimum, or maximum. Tableau requires aggregated measures, and the average of zero is always zero.\n\n\n\n\nDuplicate this calculation\n\n\nHold Ctrl (or Option on Mac) and drag AGG(avg(0)) to the right to duplicate the pill on the Rows shelf.\n\n\nNotice there are now 2 pie charts and a separate marks card for each chart.\n\n\n\n\nFormat Marks Cards\n\n\nOn the Marks Card labeled AGG(avg(0)) (2):\n\n\nClick the dropdown next to Automatic and select Circle.\n\n\nRemove Artist, CNT(rock_n_roll_studio_albums.csv) from color, size, and label.\n\n\nClick on Color:\n\n\nChange color to White.\n\n\nAdd a dark gray border.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a dual axis\n\n\nOn the second AGG(avg(0)) pill, click the ▼ caret and select Dual Axis.\n\n\n\n\nAdjust size\n\n\nOn the Marks Card labeled AGG(avg(0)):\n\n\nClick Size.\n\n\nDrag the slider to the right to increase the size of the colored pie chart.\n\n\n\nOn the Marks Card labeled AGG(avg(0)) (2):\n\n\nDrag the slider to the right to increase the size of the white circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust formatting\n\n\nRemove unnecessary lines:\n\n\nFrom the Format toolbar, select Lines.\n\n\nOn the Rows tab set:\n\n\nSet Zero Lines to None.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove borders:\n\n\nFrom the Formatting Pane select Borders.\n\n\nOn the Sheet tab, set:\n\n\nRow Divider to None on Pane:.\n\n\nColumn Divider to None on Pane:.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove headers:\n\n\nRight-click the left avg(0) axis and uncheck Show Header.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo showing steps 1-7 above\n\n\n\n\nTree Map\nTree maps are a compelling alternative to pie charts, using nested rectangles to represent the proportional size of categories relative to one another.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5. Tree Map\n\n\n\n\n\nQuickly convert the Donut Chart created in Exercise 4.\n\n\n\nDuplicate the existing sheet\n\n\nRight-click on DonutChart and select Duplicate.\n\n\nRename the new sheet TreeMap.\n\n\n\n\nOpen Show Me and select Treemaps\n\n\nOn the Marks Card\n\n\nCopy Artist to Color.\n\n\nCopy CNT(rock_n_roll_studio_albums.csv) to Label\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Percent of Total Table Calculation\n\n\nClick the ▼ caret on the CNT(rock_n_roll_studio_albums.csv) pill assigned to Label\n\n\nHover over Quick Table Calculation ► and select Percent of Total.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate title\n\n\nDouble click the worksheet title.\n\n\nEnter:\n\n\nPercentage of total albums released by 2025 inductees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental readings\n\n\n\n\nBETTER DATA VISUALIZATIONS\n\n\n\n\nBetter Data Visualizations: A Guide for Scholars, Researchers, and Wonks\n\n\n\n\nby Jonathan Schwabish\n\n\nNew York : Columbia University Press, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEFFECTIVE DATA VISUALIZATION\n\n\n\n\nEffective Data Visualization: The Right Chart for the Right Data\n\n\n\n\nby Stephanie Evergreen\n\n\nThousand Oaks, California: SAGE Publications, 2020",

Helpful Pandas methods include:\n\npd.DataFrame\nA Pandas DataFrame is one of the most powerful and commonly used data structures in Python for working with tabular data—data that is organized in rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.\nA DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with:\n\nRows (each representing an observation or record)\nColumns (each representing a variable or feature)\n\nThink of it like an Excel sheet or a table in a database.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf=pd.DataFrame([data, index, columns, dtype, copy])\n\n🔗 See __Pandas DataFrame documentation.\n\n\npd.read_csv( )\nThe pd.read_csv() function is used to read data from a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file and load it into a DataFrame.\n\npd.read_csv('INSERT FILEPATH HERE')\n\nExample:\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf=pd.read_csv('data/meet_the_animals.csv')  #df is a common abbreviation for DataFrame\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nanimal\n\n\n\n\n0\nblack-throated-blue-warbler\n\n\n1\nelds-deer\n\n\n2\nfalse-water-cobra\n\n\n3\nhooded-merganswer\n\n\n4\npatagonian-mara\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔗 See Pandas .read_csv( ) documentation.\n\n\n.tolist( )\nThe method .tolist() is used in to convert a Series (a single column of data) into a Python list.\n\ndf.Series.tolist()\n\nExample:\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf=pd.read_csv('data/meet_the_animals.csv')\nanimals=df.animal.tolist()\nanimals\n\n['black-throated-blue-warbler',\n 'elds-deer',\n 'false-water-cobra',\n 'hooded-merganswer',\n 'patagonian-mara']\n\n\n🔗 See .tolist( ) documentation.\n\n\n.dropna( )\nThe dropna() method is used to remove missing values (NaN) from a DataFrame or Series. It’s a fast and effective way to clean your data—but it should be used with care.\n\nDataFrame.dropna(*, axis=0, how=&lt;no_default&gt;, thresh=&lt;no_default&gt;, subset=None, inplace=False, ignore_index=False)\n\n\n\n.fillna( )\nThe .fillna() method is used to replace NaN (missing) values with a value you specify.\n\ndf.Series.fillna(value=None, *, method=None, axis=None, inplace=False, limit=None, downcast=&lt;no_default&gt;)\n\nThis is especially useful when you want to:\n\nFill in missing data with a default value\nUse statistical values like the mean or median\nForward-fill or backward-fill based on surrounding data\n\n🔗 See .fillna( ) documentation.\n\n\n.iterrows( )\nThe .iterrows() method allows you to iterate over each row in a DataFrame as a pair:\n\nThe index of the row\nThe row data as a pandas Series\n\n\ndf=DataFrame.iterrows()\n\nExample:\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf=pd.read_csv('data/meet_the_animals.csv')\nfor idx, row in df.iterrows():\n    print(row.animal)\n\nblack-throated-blue-warbler\nelds-deer\nfalse-water-cobra\nhooded-merganswer\npatagonian-mara\n\n\nThis is useful when you need to process rows one at a time, especially for tasks like conditional logic or row-wise operations.\n\n\nCaution!\n\n\n\n.iterrows() is not the most efficient method for large datasets. For better performance, consider using vectorized operations or .itertuples().\n\n\n\n🔗 See .iterrows( ) documentation.\n\n\n.iloc\nThe .iloc property is used to select rows (and columns) by their integer position (i.e., by index number, not label).\n\nDataFrame.iloc[start:end]\n\nExample:\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf=pd.read_csv('data/meet_the_animals.csv')\nfor idx, row in df.iloc[0:1].iterrows():\n    print(row.animal)\n\nblack-throated-blue-warbler\n\n\n\n.iloc[row_index] accesses a specific row\n.iloc[row_index, column_index] accesses a specific cell\nYou can also use slicing to select multiple rows or columns\n\nUse .iloc when:\n\nYou want to access data by position, not by label\nYou’re working with numeric row/column indices\nYou’re iterating or slicing through rows or columns\n\n🔗 See .iloc documentation.\n\n\n.concat( )\nThe pandas.concat function is used to join two or more DataFrames along a specific axis:\n\naxis=0 → stacks DataFrames vertically (adds rows)\naxis=1 → stacks DataFrames horizontally (adds columns)\n\n\npandas.concat(objs, *, axis=0, join='outer', ignore_index=False, keys=None, levels=None, names=None, verify_integrity=False, sort=False, copy=None)\n\nExample:\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\nresults=pd.DataFrame(columns=['common_name','size'])\ndf=pd.read_csv('data/meet_the_animals.csv')\nfor idx, row in df.iterrows():\n    common_name=row.animal\n    size=10\n    data_row={\n        'common_name':common_name,\n        'size':size     \n    }\n    data=pd.DataFrame(data_row, index=[0])\n    results=pd.concat([data, results], axis=0, ignore_index=True)\n\nresults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommon_name\nsize\n\n\n\n\n0\npatagonian-mara\n10\n\n\n1\nhooded-merganswer\n10\n\n\n2\nfalse-water-cobra\n10\n\n\n3\nelds-deer\n10\n\n\n4\nblack-throated-blue-warbler\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔗 See .concat documentation.",

It will help you understand how the API works and what to expect. Also, be aware if you usually work off campus, you may need to request an institutional token and answer a few additional questions. Otherwise, you will need to use your API key while connected to the university’s network.\nOnce you have your API key and institutional token, if needed, install the stable version of pybliometrics from PyPI:\n\npip install pybliometrics\n\nThe first time you use pybliometrics, you will be prompted to input your API key and institutional token. These will be saved in ~/.config/pybliometrics.cfg.\n\nimport pybliometrics",

    "text": "Using BeautifulSoup\nVarious methods and approaches may be used to gather and extract XML elements using BeautifulSoup. First we ask BeautifulSoup to search the tree to find the element nodes we identified in Step 4. Helpful methods include:\n\n.find_all( )\nGathers all instances of a tag (i.e. element) and returns a response object. Each instance of the tag is then examined using a for loop.\n\nfind_all(name, attrs, recursive, string, limit, **kwargs)\n\nExample:\n\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\nurl=\"https://osupublicationarchives.osu.edu/?a=q&r=1&results=1&tyq=ARTICLE&e=------197-en-20-LTN-1--txt-txIN-homecoming+parade------&f=XML\"\nresponse=requests.get(url).content\nsoup=BeautifulSoup(response, 'xml')\nlogical_sections = soup.find_all(\"LogicalSection\")\nfor each_section in logical_sections:\n    result_number = each_section.SearchResultNumber.string\n\nNote that each_section.SearchResultNumber in the example above is equivalent to each_section.find_all(\"SearchResultNumber\"). Appending .string to each_section.SearchResultNumber extracts the text between the tags for SearchResultNumber.\n\n\nTip:\n\n\n\n\nLearning to navigate tags with BeautifulSoup can be difficult at first. Try using Copilot in tandem with BeautifulSoup’s documentation to help you both identify and understand how to apply useful methods for your project.\n\n\nExample: Ask Copilot what is the difference between tag.string and tag.text in BeautifulSoup.\n\n\n\n\n\n.find( )\nGathers the first instance of a tag.\n\nfind(name, attrs, recursive, string, **kwargs)\n\n\n\n.find_next( ) and .find_all_next( )\nGathers the following instance of a named tag.\n\nfind_next(name, attrs, string, **kwargs)\nfind_all_next(name, attrs, string, limit, **kwargs)\n\n\n\nattributes\n\nname[attr]\n\nTags can have any number of attributes.\nExample:\nhref is an attribute of an &lt;a href=\"url\"&gt; tag. To find an `href attribute value:\n\na['href']\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Gather and extract elements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine the XML structure and identify the nodes for the following elements:\n\n\nunique_id\n\n\narticle_title\n\n\narticle_type\n\n\ndocument_date\n\n\n\n\nWrite a Python script that uses csv and BeautifulSoup to gather and store these elements. Focus on the first 20 search results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n# 1. Import libraries\nimport requests\nimport csv\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# 2. Create a function to write search results to csv\ndef writeto_csv(data, filename, columns):\n    with open(filename, 'w+', newline='', encoding=\"UTF-8\") as file:\n        writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=columns)\n        writer.writeheader()\n        writer = csv.writer(file)\n        for element in data:\n            writer.writerows([element])\n\n\n\n# 3. Define headers for final dataset\ncolumns=['result_number','unique_id','artile_title','article_type','document_date']\n\n#4. Create empty dataset to store each row of data for csv file\ndataset = []\n\n#5. Retrieve the XML\nurl=\"https://osupublicationarchives.osu.edu/?a=q&r=1&results=1&tyq=ARTICLE&e=------197-en-20-LTN-1--txt-txIN-homecoming+parade------&f=XML\"\nresponse=requests.get(url).content\n\n#6. Parse the content with Beautiful Soup \nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response, 'xml')    \nlogical_sections = soup.find_all(\"LogicalSection\")\nfor each_section in logical_sections:\n    result_number = each_section.SearchResultNumber.string\n    unique_id = each_section.find(\"LogicalSectionID\").string\n    article_title = each_section.find(\"LogicalSectionTitle\").string\n    article_type = each_section.find(\"LogicalSectionType\").string\n    document_date = each_section.find(\"DocumentDate\").string\n    dataset.append([result_number,unique_id,article_title,article_type,document_date]) #adds a list of variables for each section to the dataset\n\n#7. Use the writeto_csv function defined in #2 to create the final .csv file with each row  \nwriteto_csv(dataset,'data/lantern_results.csv',columns)     #uses the function defined in #2 to create the final .csv file with each row  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Modify code\n\n\n\n\nModify your code to gather search results 1-51.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n# 1.

Create a for loop to search each page of results. Use range(start, stop, step) to ask\n# Python to increment i by 20 for each loop. The first SearchResultNumber (i.e. start) is 1. The last\n# SearchResultNumber (i.e. stop) is 51.  Construct a new url for the response variable.\n# Parse the response content with Beautiful Soup.\nfor i in range(1,51,20):\n    response=requests.get(url1+str(i)+url2).content \n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response, 'xml')    \n    logical_section = soup.find_all(\"LogicalSection\")\n    for each_section in logical_section:\n        result_number = each_section.SearchResultNumber.string\n        unique_id = each_section.find(\"LogicalSectionID\").string\n        article_title = each_section.find(\"LogicalSectionTitle\").string\n        article_type = each_section.find(\"LogicalSectionType\").string\n        document_date = each_section.find(\"DocumentDate\").string\n        dataset.append([result_number,unique_id,article_title,article_type,document_date]) #adds a list of variables for each section to the dataset\n\n#7.

    "text": "Handling dynamic content\nThe Electronic Theses and Dissertations Center is a dynamic website. While the page layout, such as headers, footers, and overall structure, is built with static HTML, the search results are loaded dynamically via JavaScript after the initial page load. If you inspect the page using browser Developer Tools, you’ll find that search results are inserted into the element &lt;t-SearchResults-content&gt;:\nExample:\n\n&lt;div class=\"t-SearchResults-content\"&gt;\n            &lt;h3 class=\"t-SearchResults-title\"&gt;\n                1. &lt;span class=\"t-SearchResults-author\"&gt;Mackey-Alfonso, Sabrina&lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;a href=\"/acprod/odb_etd/r/etd/search/10?p10_accession_num=osu1744894008278402&amp;clear=10&amp;session=10473290292427\"&gt;Short-term High Fat Diet Accelerates Synaptic and Memory Deficits via Neuroinflammatory Mechanisms in an Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/h3&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"t-SearchResults-info\"&gt;\n              &lt;p class=\"t-SearchResults-degree\"&gt;\n                  Doctor of Philosophy, The Ohio State University, 2025, Neuroscience Graduate Studies Program\n              &lt;/p&gt;\n              &lt;p class=\"t-SearchResults-desc hide-class\"&gt;&lt;div style=\"overflow: hidden; height: 40px;\"&gt;Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by profound memory impairments, synaptic loss, neuroinflammation, and hallmark pathological markers. High-fat diet (HFD) consumption increases the risk of developing AD even after controlling for metabolic syndrome, pointing to a role of the diet itself in increasing risk. In AD, the complement system, an arm of the immune system which normally tags redundant or damaged synapses for pruning, becomes pathologically overactivated leading to tagging of healthy synapses. While the unhealthy diet to AD link is strong, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood in part due to confounding variables associated with long-term HFD which can independently influence the brain. Therefore, we experimented with a short-term diet regimen to isolate the diet's impact on brain function without causing changes in metabolic markers.\nThis project investigated potential mechanisms underlying cognitive impairments evoked by short-term diet consumption using the 3xTg-AD model. In chapter 1 we discuss the link between HFD and AD and outline the current findings and hypothesis regarding of relevant mechanisms. In chapter 2 we characterize the effect of short-term HFD on 1) memory, 2) neuroinflammation including complement, 3) AD pathology markers, 4) synaptic markers, and 5) in vitro microglial synaptic phagocytosis in the 3xTg-AD mouse model. In chapter 3 we analyze two potential mechanisms underlying HFD-mediated AD vulnerability: toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-evoked neuroinflammation and complement system activation. Finally, in chapter 4 we validate the absence of glucose modifications as an effect of the diet and drug treatment, explore potential mitochondrial mechanisms in the hippocampus, and evaluate the diet's impact on the pre-frontal cortex (PFC).\nFollowing the consumption of either standard chow or HFD, 3xTg-AD mice exhibited impaired long-term memory performance which was associated with increased level (open full item for complete abstract)&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a href=\"#\" data-ctrl=\"\" class=\"\"&gt;... &lt;em&gt;More&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n              &lt;span class=\"t-SearchResults-misc\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Committee:&lt;/b&gt; Ruth Barrientos (Advisor); Benedetta Leuner (Committee Member); Nikki Kokiko-Cochran (Committee Member); Harry Fu (Committee Member)&lt;/span&gt;\n              &lt;span class=\"t-SearchResults-misc\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subjects:&lt;/b&gt; Neurosciences&lt;/span&gt;\n              &lt;!-- span class=\"t-SearchResults-misc\"&gt;Score: 100&lt;/span --&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n\nThis setup allows the site to update content without reloading the entire page.\n⚠️ Why requests and BeautifulSoup Alone Won’t Work\nIf you try to scrape the page using requests and BeautifulSoup, you’ll notice that the response only contains the static HTML shell—none of the dynamically loaded search results are included. That’s because the content is rendered by JavaScript, which requests cannot execute.\n🛠️ Workaround for Small-Scale Projects\nIf you’re working on a small project and just need to extract a limited number of results, you can manually save the page and parse it locally:\n✅ Steps:\n\nSet Results Per Page to 100 to minimize the number of pages you need to save.\nRight-click on the results per page and choose Save As.\nSelect **Webpage, Single File (*.mhtml)** as the format.\nOpen the saved .mhtml file using Notepad or any other plain text editor.\nDelete everything above the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; line.\nSave the file again, changing the extension from .mhtml to .html.\n\nOnce saved as a .html file, you can read and parse it using BeautifulSoup.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: Save HTML\n\n\n\n\nSave your results from Exercise 1 by following the steps listed above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Parse HTML\n\n\n\n\n\nUse BeautifulSoup to extract the following elements from your saved HTML file:\n\n\ntitle\n\n\nauthor\n\n\ndegree\n\n\ndegre_year\n\n\nadvisor\n\n\ncommittee_members\n\n\nsubjects\n\n\n\n\nRemember to read the HTML` file into Python first. Export the results to a CSV file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\n\n\n\n\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport pandas as pd\n\nresults=pd.DataFrame()\n\ncontents = open('data/results.html').read()\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(contents, 'html.parser')\netds = soup.find_all(attrs={\"class\":'3D\"t-SearchResults-content\"'})\n\nfor each_etd in etds:\n\n    row={}\n    title=each_etd.find(\"h3\").find(\"a\").text.replace('=\\n','').replace('=',' ')\n    row['title']=title\n    author=each_etd.find('span', {\"class\":'3D\"t-SearchResults-author\"'}).text.replace('=\\n','').split('\\n')[0]\n    row['author']=author\n    degree=each_etd.find('p', {\"class\":'3D\"t-SearchResults-degree\"'}).text.split(',')[0].strip()\n    row['degree']=degree\n    degree_year=each_etd.find('p', {\"class\":'3D\"t-SearchResults-degree\"'}).text.split(',')[2].strip()\n    row['degree_year']=degree_year\n    misc_results=author=each_etd.find_all('span', {\"class\":'3D\"t-SearchResults-misc\"'})\n\n    advisors=[]\n    committee=[]\n    subjects=[]\n    for misc in misc_results:\n        if \"Committee:\" in misc.text:\n            members=misc.text.replace('=\\n','').replace(\"Committee: \",\"\").split(';')\n            for member in members:\n                if \"advisor\" in member.lower():\n                    advisors.append(member.split('(')[0].replace('=\\n','').strip())\n                    committee.append(member.split('(')[0].replace('=\\n','').strip())\n                else:\n                    committee.append(member.split('(')[0].strip())\n\n        elif \"Subjects:\" in misc.text:\n            subjs=misc.text.replace('=\\n','').replace(\"Subjects: \",\"\").split(';')\n            for subject in subjs:\n                subjects.append(subject.strip())\n\n                \n    advisors=(';').join(advisors).rstrip(';')\n    row['advisors']=advisors\n    committee=(';').join(committee).rstrip(';')\n    row['committee']=committee\n    subjects=(';').join(subjects).rstrip(';')\n    row['subjects']=subjects\n    \n    df_row=pd.DataFrame(row, index=[0])\n    results=pd.concat([df_row, results], axis=0, ignore_index=True)\n    \nresults.to_csv('data/npsg.csv')\n\n\n\n\nFor larger projects, consider using tools such as Requests-HTML or Selenium, which are capable of rendering JavaScript—making them ideal for scraping dynamic web content that standard libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup can’t access.",

The Performers category honors recording artists and bands who have had a significant and lasting impact on the development and legacy of rock and roll.\nThat said, you’re encouraged to use a dataset that’s personally meaningful to you! Feel free to substitute the example with your own data as you work through the practice activities in this tutorial.\nTo connect to rock_n_roll_performers.csv in your workshop materials.\nOn Tableau’s Start Page\n\nGo to the Connect pane on the left.\nSelect Text file.\nNavigate to and open the CSV file.\n\nThis opens the Data Source Page.\n\n\nOn the Data Source page you’ll find:\nThe Connections** pane on the left. Tableau Desktop allows multiple connections, which can be joined or related using common fields. For this tutorial, we will keep things simple and use only the rock_n_roll_performers.csv file.\nThe Canvas in the top center. The canvas displays the rock_n_roll_performers.csv file in a rectangle. Right-click on this rectangle or use the ▼ caret to:\n\nRename tables\nJoin and relate tables\nApply pre-filters to your data\n\nThe Metadata Grid in the bottom center. Here the data headers are displayed as rows. This feature is particularly helpful when you connect to a dataset with multiple tables and fields. The metadata grid allows you to:\n\nUnderstand your data structure\nChange data types\nHide unnecessary fields not required for your analysis\n\nThe Data Grid on the bottom right. The data grid shows the first 1,000 rows of data in your data source. In the data grid you can:\n\nPivot data\nCreate groups and bins\nBuild calculated fields\n\n\nDimensions vs. measures - Part 1\n\nWhat is a measure?\nThink of a measure as a variable used for math. Measures represent our quantitative data or units of measure.\n\n\nWhat is a dimension?\nDimensions represent the qualitative data used to segment the measures. \n\n\nDimension or measure?\nDimensions sometimes function as measures. Age, for example, can be used to categorize data, or as a measure in a calculation. Measures sometimes function as dimensions. An identification number, for example, can represent a person, yet consist of all numbers. If the identification number is added sequentially to a database, it may also be used in a calculation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Dimensions and Measures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange data type - Option 1\nThe metadata grid for the rock_n_roll_performers.csv dataset primarily shows dimensions. The Index field represents an identification number and can serve as a dimension or measure. The Year field is currently recognized as a whole number. To change the data type of the Year field:\n\nLocate the YEAR field in the metadata grid.\nRight-click on the number icon before the field name.\nSelect Date & Time from the menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nField Name\nPhysical Table\nRemote Field Name\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber (whole)\nIndex\nrock_n_roll_performers.csv\nindex\n\n\n\nDate & Time\nYear\nrock_n_roll_performers.csv\nyear\n\n\n\nString\nImage\nrock_n_roll_performers.csv\nimage\n\n\n\nString\nName\nrock_n_roll_performers.csv\nname\n\n\n\nString\nInducted Members\nrock_n_roll_performers.csv\ninducted_members\n\n\n\nString\nPrior Nominations\nrock_n_roll_performers.csv\nprior_nominations\n\n\n\nString\nInduction Presenter\nrock_n_roll_performers.csv\ninduction_presenter\n\n\n\nString\nArtist\nrock_n_roll_performers.csv\nartist\n\n\n\nString\nImage Url\nrock_n_roll_performers.csv\nimage_url\n\n\n\nString\nArtist Url\nrock_n_roll_performers.csv\nartist_url\n\n\n\n\n\nWide vs. tall data\nSometimes to efficiently and effectively analyze and/or visualize data we must restructure our data from wide to tall format. In Figure 1 above, each individual is represented by a single row, with separate columns for name, age, and number of visits. To transform this data into tall format, each individual would have a row for each measure. This structure includes:\n\nA column for the measure name (e.g., “Age”, “Visits”)\nA column for the measure values (e.g., 34, 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Tall data\n\n\n\nFor many Tableau projects, converting data to a tall format can enhance analysis and visualization.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1. Transform data to a tall format\n\n\n\n\n\nTry transforming the rock_n_roll_performers.csv dataset from wide to tall format using Tableau’s pivot feature.\n\n\n\nIn the data grid, click to highlight the Year column.\n\n\nHold the Shift key, scroll to the right, and click to highlight the Artist Url column.\n\n\nClick the ▼ caret on right side of the Artist Url column and select Pivot.\n\n\nTableau will transform the selected columns from a wide format (many columns) to tall format (fewer columns, more rows). ✅ This is useful for reshaping data to make it easier to analyze or visualize in Tableau.\n\n\nTo undo the pivot, press Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Command+Z (Mac).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:",

Merge datasets\nAfter loading the performers and studio_albums tables using pd.read_csv, we can inspect the column headers using .columns.\n\nperformers.columns\n\nIndex(['index', 'year', 'image', 'name', 'inducted_members',\n       'prior_nominations', 'induction_presenter', 'artist', 'image_url',\n       'artist_url'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\n\nstudio_albums.columns\n\nIndex(['index', 'album_title', 'artist', 'certification_aria',\n       'certification_aria_status', 'certification_aria_x',\n       'certification_bmvi', 'certification_bmvi_status',\n       'certification_bmvi_x', 'certification_bpi', 'certification_bpi_status',\n       'certification_bpi_x', 'certification_mc', 'certification_mc_status',\n       'certification_mc_x', 'certification_riaa', 'certification_riaa_status',\n       'certification_riaa_x', 'certification_snep',\n       'certification_snep_status', 'certification_snep_x', 'day',\n       'format_4_track', 'format_8_track', 'format_blueray', 'format_box_set',\n       'format_cassette', 'format_cd', 'format_digital_compact_cassette',\n       'format_digital_download', 'format_dvd', 'format_lp',\n       'format_mini_disc', 'format_picture_disc', 'format_reel',\n       'format_streaming', 'format_vhs', 'month', 'peakAUS', 'peakAUT',\n       'peakCAN', 'peakFRA', 'peakGER', 'peakIRE', 'peakITA', 'peakJPN',\n       'peakNLD', 'peakNOR', 'peakNZ', 'peakSPA', 'peakSWE', 'peakSWI',\n       'peakUK', 'peakUS', 'peakUS Country', 'peakUS R&B', 'Record label',\n       'Release date', 'year'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\nBoth datasets share the columns artist and year, which could be used for merging. However, to avoid confusion after joining, we’ll first rename the header year in the performers dataset to year_inducted.\n\n.rename()\n\nperformers=performers.rename(columns={'year':'year_inducted'})  \nperformers.columns\n\nIndex(['index', 'year_inducted', 'image', 'name', 'inducted_members',\n       'prior_nominations', 'induction_presenter', 'artist', 'image_url',\n       'artist_url'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\nThen, we’ll merge the two datasets using the shared artist column.\n\nperformers_albums=pd.merge(performers, studio_albums, on='artist')\nperformers_albums.columns\n\nIndex(['index_x', 'year_inducted', 'image', 'name', 'inducted_members',\n       'prior_nominations', 'induction_presenter', 'artist', 'image_url',\n       'artist_url', 'index_y', 'album_title', 'certification_aria',\n       'certification_aria_status', 'certification_aria_x',\n       'certification_bmvi', 'certification_bmvi_status',\n       'certification_bmvi_x', 'certification_bpi', 'certification_bpi_status',\n       'certification_bpi_x', 'certification_mc', 'certification_mc_status',\n       'certification_mc_x', 'certification_riaa', 'certification_riaa_status',\n       'certification_riaa_x', 'certification_snep',\n       'certification_snep_status', 'certification_snep_x', 'day',\n       'format_4_track', 'format_8_track', 'format_blueray', 'format_box_set',\n       'format_cassette', 'format_cd', 'format_digital_compact_cassette',\n       'format_digital_download', 'format_dvd', 'format_lp',\n       'format_mini_disc', 'format_picture_disc', 'format_reel',\n       'format_streaming', 'format_vhs', 'month', 'peakAUS', 'peakAUT',\n       'peakCAN', 'peakFRA', 'peakGER', 'peakIRE', 'peakITA', 'peakJPN',\n       'peakNLD', 'peakNOR', 'peakNZ', 'peakSPA', 'peakSWE', 'peakSWI',\n       'peakUK', 'peakUS', 'peakUS Country', 'peakUS R&B', 'Record label',\n       'Release date', 'year'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Create and apply filters\nNow that we’ve merged the inductee and album datasets, we can begin filtering the data to focus on specific trends or groups.\nBefore applying any filters, it’s important to confirm the data type of the year_inducted column in the performers_albums DataFrame. This ensures we can perform numerical comparisons or sorting without errors.\n\n.dtypes\n\nperformers_albums['year_inducted'].dtypes\n\ndtype('int64')\n\n\nWe can create and apply filter to isolate the 2025 inductees using the year_inducted field.\n\n\nfilter_variable=df[‘column’]==value\n\n#First create the filter\n_2025_inductees= performers_albums['year_inducted']==2025 \n\n\n\nfiltered_df=df[filter_variable]\n\n#Then apply the filter\nperformers_albums_filtered=performers_albums[_2025_inductees]\nperformers_albums_filtered\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindex_x\nyear_inducted\nimage\nname\ninducted_members\nprior_nominations\ninduction_presenter\nartist\nimage_url\nartist_url\n...\npeakSWI\npeakUK\npeakUS\npeakUS Country\npeakUS R&B\nRecord label\nRelease date\nyear\nFormatted Release date\nRelease year\n\n\n\n\n4770\n264\n2025\nNaN\nBad Company[193]\nBoz Burrell, Simon Kirke, Mick Ralphs, and Pau...\nFirst nomination\nNaN\nBad Company\n/wiki/File:Bad_Company_-_1976.jpg\n/wiki/Bad_Company\n...\nNaN\n3.0\n1.0\nNaN\nNaN\nIsland, Swan Song\n1974-05-24\n1974\n1974\n1974\n\n\n4771\n264\n2025\nNaN\nBad Company[193]\nBoz Burrell, Simon Kirke, Mick Ralphs, and Pau...\nFirst nomination\nNaN\nBad Company\n/wiki/File:Bad_Company_-_1976.jpg\n/wiki/Bad_Company\n...\nNaN\n3.0\n3.0\nNaN\nNaN\nIsland, Swan Song\n1975-03-28\n1975\n1975\n1975\n\n\n4772\n264\n2025\nNaN\nBad Company[193]\nBoz Burrell, Simon Kirke, Mick Ralphs, and Pau...\nFirst nomination\nNaN\nBad Company\n/wiki/File:Bad_Company_-_1976.jpg\n/wiki/Bad_Company\n...\nNaN\n4.0\n5.0\nNaN\nNaN\nIsland, Swan Song\n1976-01-30\n1976\n1976\n1976\n\n\n4773\n264\n2025\nNaN\nBad Company[193]\nBoz Burrell, Simon Kirke, Mick Ralphs, and Pau...\nFirst nomination\nNaN\nBad Company\n/wiki/File:Bad_Company_-_1976.jpg\n/wiki/Bad_Company\n...\nNaN\n17.0\n15.0\nNaN\nNaN\nIsland, Swan Song\n1977-03-03\n1977\n1977\n1977\n\n\n4774\n264\n2025\nNaN\nBad Company[193]\nBoz Burrell, Simon Kirke, Mick Ralphs, and Pau...\nFirst nomination\nNaN\nBad Company\n/wiki/File:Bad_Company_-_1976.jpg\n/wiki/Bad_Company\n...\nNaN\n10.0\n3.0\nNaN\nNaN\nSwan Song\n1979-03-07\n1979\n1979\n1979\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n4846\n270\n2025\nNaN\nThe White Stripes[193]\nJack White and Meg White.[197][198]\n1 (2023)\nNaN\nThe White Stripes\n/wiki/File:Jack_%26_Meg,_The_White_Stripes.jpg\n/wiki/The_White_Stripes\n...\nNaN\n137.0\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nSympathy for the Record Industry\n2000-06-20\n2000\n2000\n2000\n\n\n4847\n270\n2025\nNaN\nThe White Stripes[193]\nJack White and Meg White.[197][198]\n1 (2023)\nNaN\nThe White Stripes\n/wiki/File:Jack_%26_Meg,_The_White_Stripes.jpg\n/wiki/The_White_Stripes\n...\nNaN\n55.0\n61.0\nNaN\nNaN\nSympathy for the Record Industry, Third Man Re...\n2001-07-03\n2001\n2001\n2001\n\n\n4848\n270\n2025\nNaN\nThe White Stripes[193]\nJack White and Meg White.[197][198]\n1 (2023)\nNaN\nThe White Stripes\n/wiki/File:Jack_%26_Meg,_The_White_Stripes.jpg\n/wiki/The_White_Stripes\n...\nNaN\n1.0\n6.0\nNaN\nNaN\nV2\n2003-04-01\n2003\n2003\n2003\n\n\n4849\n270\n2025\nNaN\nThe White Stripes[193]\nJack White and Meg White.[197][198]\n1 (2023)\nNaN\nThe White Stripes\n/wiki/File:Jack_%26_Meg,_The_White_Stripes.jpg\n/wiki/The_White_Stripes\n...\nNaN\n3.0\n3.0\nNaN\nNaN\nV2\n2005-06-07\n2005\n2005\n2005\n\n\n4850\n270\n2025\nNaN\nThe White Stripes[193]\nJack White and Meg White.[197][198]\n1 (2023)\nNaN\nThe White Stripes\n/wiki/File:Jack_%26_Meg,_The_White_Stripes.jpg\n/wiki/The_White_Stripes\n...\nNaN\n1.0\n2.0\nNaN\nNaN\nThird Man, Warner Bros.\n2007-06-15\n2007\n2007\n2007\n\n\n\n\n81 rows × 70 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Aggregate data\nPandas supports a variety of basic summary statistics through build-in methods:\n\n\n\nMethod\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n.count()\nnumber of observations\n\n\n.sum()\nhistogram\n\n\n.mean()\nboxplot\n\n\n.medium()\ndensity plots\n\n\n.min()\narea plots\n\n\n.max()\nscatterplots\n\n\nmode()\nhexagonal bin plots\n\n\nstd()\npie charts\n\n\n\n\n.groupby()\nTo calculate statistics grouped by category—such as average chart positions by artist or year—we use the .groupby() method. This allows us to aggregate data based on one or more columns before applying summary functions.\n\nperformers_albums_filtered.groupby('artist')['peakUS'].mean()\n\nartist\nBad Company          41.000000\nChubby Checker       57.333333\nCyndi Lauper         59.100000\nJoe Cocker           62.571429\nOutkast               4.833333\nSoundgarden          31.000000\nThe White Stripes    18.000000\nName: peakUS, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. Plot\nThe last step to build our bar chart is to add the .plot(*args, **kwargs) method with relevant arguments and keyword arguments.\nFirst use the .sort_values(ascending=False) method first to sort the bars in descending order. Then .plot with the keyword arguments:\n\nkind = ‘bar’\nxlabel = ’’ (removes the redundant label on the x-axis)\ntitle = ‘Peak US Chart Position: Rock N Roll Hall of Fame Inductees’ (= newline)\n\n\nperformers_albums_filtered.groupby('artist')['peakUS'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False).plot(kind='bar', xlabel='', title='Average Peak US Chart Position: \\n 2025 Rock N Roll Hall of Fame Inductees')",
