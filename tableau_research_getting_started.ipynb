    "# Reading data\n",
    "Reading data effectively requires us to slow down and critically evaluate a dataset to understand its origins, who the dataset was created by and why, how the data was collected, and more. Data is not inherently neutral and context matters. Data analysts have a responsibility to recognize and disclose potential data biases that may distort visualizations and lead to misleading interpretations or narratives.  A thorough examination of the dataset’s structure—including its dimensions (categorical variables) and measures (quantitative variables)—and a clear understanding of how these elements are defined, is fundamental to responsible and accurate data analysis.\n",
