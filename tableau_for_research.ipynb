    "Data literacy is \"the ability to read, work with, analyze, and argue with data.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reading data:** Understanding what data represents and how it reflects the world around us.\n",
    "- **Working with data:** Creating, acquiring, cleaning, and managing datasets.\n",
    "- **Analyzing data:** Filtering, sorting, aggregating, comparing, and analyzing data.\n",
    "- **Arguing with data:** Using data to support a narrative that is intended to communicate some message or story to a particular audience. [@bhargava_2015]\n",
    "\n",
    "Data literacy concepts and competencies are integrated throughout this tutorial to help you build strong skills in data visualization and storytelling. In addition to interpreting and evaluating data, we'll explore data handling, data synthesis, ethical use of data, and best practices for presenting data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at data collected by others - whether it is raw data or data published in an article - it is important to understand what the data means, how it was collected, and who collected it. You must critically evaluate each data source before you consider using data to support an argument. Approach your data with curiosity and some skepticism.\n",
