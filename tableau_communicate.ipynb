    "\n",
    "For example, in the `rock_n_roll_studio_albums` table, you’ll find album certification statuses from organizations like the __[RIAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America)__, __[BPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Phonographic_Industry)__, and __[ARIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Recording_Industry_Association)__. With calculated fields, you can standardize these certifications, compare award levels across countries, or even create new fields that group albums by global recognition—making your analysis more insightful and dynamic.\n",

Originally based solely on album sales, certifications now account for digital downloads and streaming activity.
